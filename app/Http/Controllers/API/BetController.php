    - had to switch workaholic mood since you've been gone, mind can't stay awake without thinking about u
- I'm doing ok for myself and some would say I'm walking on diamonds but I'm always high as a moon cuz miss u so bad and on your birthday, I jogged 3 extra miles while listening to Jimi Hendrix strumming those guitar strings all the way (I cried a lil bit though).
- not been able to see u or talk to u is not the worst part, the worst part is I didn't get a choice, God just took u away without bracing me up for it.. some say God is sadistic, I can't say I blame them. I guess happiness is gluttony or sth every moment with u was like walking on sunshine, u get my jokes, men are not supposed to be admit sensitive to real human moments cuz is masculine or something.
